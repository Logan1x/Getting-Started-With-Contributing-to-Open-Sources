# What are Umbrella Organisations? 

This is a term which you may or may not have heard of in the Open Source world as such organisations are more prevelant or rather relevant inside the Google Summer of Code framework. Umbrella organisations are basically large oorganisations which have smaller sub-organisations under it. 

The reason for their clustering under a parent organisation varies. There might be several factors for such a structure.
* These organisations are funded/supported by the parent organisation or are branches of the organisation.
* Small/first-time organisations come together as an organisation to increase their chances of selection into their programme. 
* Small/first-time organisation merges under a well established organisation to increase their chances of selection the programme. 
* A strong language based organisation which floats several of it's popular modules as its suborganisations.
